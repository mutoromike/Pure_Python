1. Higher order functions
 - Functions that take in other functions as inputs, or return other functions
 or function objects.

 Example: Returning a function objects
 inner() is the inner function in this case, and outer() is our higher-order function.

 def outer():
    def inner():
        print("Inner Function")
    return inner

func = outer()
func
print(func)

In the example above, calling outer() will return outer.inner(), i.e. the inner()
function object as shown below;

Inner Function
<function outer.<locals>.inner at 0x10457f370>

From above, it is evident that the global function is just a reference to the inner function.
